## Welcome to Recbrain Recommender System

This is a News Recommender System implemented in Python, using an Online Reinforcement Learning approach, based on [MIND](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/mind-a-large-scale-dataset-for-news-recommendation/) dataset.

In each iteration, user id must be submitted, then news title and news abstract will be presented. Next, the model needs user feedback.

User ids must be something like: U687515, U192112, U629430, U449564, U24161, U79744, U219005, ...
