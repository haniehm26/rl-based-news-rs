## General Info

### Who We Are?
We are RecBrain, four talented data science enthusiasts:
+ [Hanieh Mahdavi]()
+ [Mohammadamin Farajzadeh]()
+ [Mahta Zarean]()
+ [Amir Asrzad]()

Gather together in [Rahnema College]() Machine Learning Internship Program with mentorship of [Matin Zivdar]().

### What Is Our Project About?
We worked on a News Recommender System based on Reinforcement Learning models.
Our first challenge was how to extract information from news texts and categories that represent precisely the data.
Second challenge was how to formulate problem in a RL literature. Finally, we had to figure out how to train the model in offline manner.
