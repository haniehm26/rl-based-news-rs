## General Info
### Who We Are?
We are RecBrain, four data science enthusiasts:
+ [Hanieh Mahdavi](https://github.com/haniehm26)
+ [Mohammadamin Farajzadeh](https://github.com/mafzs)
+ [Mahta Zarean](https://github.com/mahtaz)
+ [Amir Asrzad](https://github.com/AMIRASRZAD)

Gather together in [Rahnema College](https://rahnemacollege.com/) Machine Learning Internship Program with mentorship of [Matin Zivdar](https://github.com/zivdar001matin).

### What Is Our Project About?
We implemented a News Recommender System with an Online Reinforcement Learning approach, based on [MIND](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/mind-a-large-scale-dataset-for-news-recommendation/) dataset.
Our first challenge was how to extract information from news texts and categories that represent precisely the data.
Second challenge was how to formulate problem in a RL literature. Finally, we had to figure out how to train the model in offline manner.
